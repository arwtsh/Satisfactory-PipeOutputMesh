# Pipe Output Mesh

This is a library mod intented to assist other modders.

Satisfactory contains input and output meshes at `/Content/FactoryGame/Buildable/Factory/FactoryInputs/Mesh/`. These meshes are useful when a building needs to switch connector types but only use one main building mesh. Modders can attach these input/output meshes as components onto the blueprint as an FGColoredInstanceMeshProxy.

Satisfactory only has 3 of the 4 factory connections; this mod adds the missing pipe output.
